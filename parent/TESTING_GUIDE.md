## 🧪 Testing Your Integration

### Step 1: Check Firebase Configuration

Before testing, ensure you have:

- [ ] Created a Firebase project
- [ ] Added your app to Firebase (Android/iOS/Web)
- [ ] Downloaded `google-services.json` (Android) to `android/app/`
- [ ] Downloaded `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) to `ios/Runner/`
- [ ] Enabled Email/Password authentication in Firebase Console
- [ ] Enabled Firestore Database
- [ ] Enabled Firebase Storage
- [ ] Deployed security rules

### Step 2: Test Authentication Flow

#### Test Sign Up:

```
1. Run the app: flutter run
2. Click "Get Started" on welcome screen
3. Click "Create New Account"
4. Fill in the form:
   - First Name: Test
   - Last Name: User
   - Phone: +250123456789
   - Address: Kigali/Gasabo
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Password: test123 (min 6 chars)
   - Confirm Password: test123
5. Check "I agree to terms"
6. Click "Register"
7. Should see success message
8. Should auto-login and go to main app
```

**Expected Result:**

- ✅ User created in Firebase Authentication
- ✅ Auto-login successful
- ✅ Redirected to main app screen

**Verify in Firebase Console:**

- Go to Authentication > Users
- Should see new user with email `test@example.com`

#### Test Sign In:

```
1. If logged in, logout first (drawer menu > Logout)
2. Click "Get Started"
3. Enter email and password
4. Check "I agree to terms"
5. Click "Login"
6. Should auto-navigate to main app
```

**Expected Result:**

- ✅ Login successful
- ✅ User data loaded
- ✅ Redirected to main app

#### Test Sign Out:

```
1. Open drawer menu (hamburger icon)
2. Click "Logout"
3. Confirm logout
4. Should return to welcome screen
```

**Expected Result:**

- ✅ User logged out
- ✅ Redirected to welcome screen
- ✅ Cannot access protected screens

#### Test Password Reset:

```
1. On login screen, click "Forgot Password?"
2. Enter your email
3. Click "Send Reset Link"
4. Check your email for reset link
```

**Expected Result:**

- ✅ Reset email sent
- ✅ Success message shown
- ✅ Email received (check spam folder)

### Step 3: Test Audio Upload

#### Upload Audio File:

```
1. Sign in to the app
2. Go to "Audio" tab (bottom navigation)
3. Click "Select Audio File"
4. Choose an audio file from your device
5. Click "Upload"
6. Wait for upload to complete
```

**Expected Result:**

- ✅ File selected successfully
- ✅ Upload progress dialog shown
- ✅ Success message with "VIEW" action
- ✅ File uploaded to Firebase Storage
- ✅ History saved to Firestore

**Verify in Firebase Console:**

1. **Storage:**

   - Go to Storage > Files
   - Navigate to: `users/{userId}/audio_files/`
   - Should see uploaded audio file

2. **Firestore:**
   - Go to Firestore Database
   - Navigate to: `users/{userId}/audio_history/`
   - Should see new document with upload details

### Step 4: Test Firebase Connection

Use the Firebase Test Screen (for debugging):

```dart
// Add this to your app temporarily for testing
import 'package:parent/screens/firebase_test_screen.dart';

// In your drawer or somewhere accessible:
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => const FirebaseTestScreen(),
  ),
);
```

This will test:

- ✅ Firebase Core initialization
- ✅ Firebase Auth connection
- ✅ Firestore connection
- ✅ Storage connection

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Firebase not initialized"

**Solution:**

```bash
# Ensure google-services.json is in android/app/
# Ensure GoogleService-Info.plist is in ios/Runner/
# Run:
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Issue: "No user found" when signing in

**Solution:**

- The user must first sign up
- Check Firebase Console > Authentication to verify user exists
- Try password reset if you forgot password

### Issue: "Permission denied" when uploading

**Possible Causes:**

1. User not authenticated - Sign in first
2. Security rules not deployed - Run: `firebase deploy --only storage:rules`
3. Storage not enabled - Enable in Firebase Console

**Solution:**

```bash
# Deploy security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
firebase deploy --only storage:rules

# Verify user is signed in
# Check Firebase Console > Authentication
```

### Issue: "Invalid email or password"

**Solution:**

- Email must be valid format (e.g., user@example.com)
- Password must be at least 6 characters
- Check for typos
- Try password reset

### Issue: "Email already in use"

**Solution:**

- Use a different email
- OR sign in with existing account
- OR delete user from Firebase Console and try again

### Issue: Upload fails silently

**Check:**

1. Internet connection
2. File size (must be under 50MB)
3. File type (must be audio)
4. User is authenticated
5. Firebase Storage is enabled

**Debug:**

```dart
// Check console for error messages
// Check Firebase Console > Storage > Rules
// Ensure rules allow authenticated users to write
```

## 📊 Monitoring

### Check User Activity:

1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Click on Authentication
3. View users, sign-in methods, and activity

### Check Storage Usage:

1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Click on Storage
3. View files, usage statistics

### Check Firestore Data:

1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Click on Firestore Database
3. Browse collections and documents

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### Current Security Rules:

**Firestore** (`firestore.rules`):

- ✅ Users can only read/write their own data
- ✅ Authentication required for all operations
- ✅ Validation on required fields

**Storage** (`storage.rules`):

- ✅ Users can only access their own files
- ✅ File size limit: 50MB
- ✅ Only audio MIME types allowed
- ✅ Authentication required

### Before Production:

- [ ] Review and update security rules
- [ ] Enable App Check
- [ ] Set up budget alerts
- [ ] Configure backup strategies
- [ ] Enable Firebase Analytics
- [ ] Set up crash reporting
- [ ] Add rate limiting

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate:

1. ✅ Test all auth flows (sign up, sign in, sign out)
2. ✅ Test audio upload
3. ✅ Verify data in Firebase Console

### Short-term:

- [ ] Integrate ML model for audio analysis
- [ ] Add email verification
- [ ] Add user profile management
- [ ] Add offline support
- [ ] Add upload progress indicator

### Long-term:

- [ ] Add social login (Google, Facebook)
- [ ] Add push notifications
- [ ] Add analytics tracking
- [ ] Add crash reporting
- [ ] Prepare for production deployment
